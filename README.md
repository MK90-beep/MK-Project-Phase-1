# Overview

This repository contains an analysis focused on aircraft safety, aimed at providing actionable insights for stakeholders. The project explores aviation accident data to address key business questions and derive meaningful conclusions.

# Business Understanding

## Stakeholders:

Aviation Safety Analysts

Aircraft Manufacturers

Airline Operators

Regulatory Authorities

## Key Business Questions:

What are the most common causes of aircraft accidents and fatalities?

Which aircraft categories and makes have the highest accident rates?

How do accident trends vary over time?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

## Source of Data:

The data used in this project is sourced from aviation accident reports and regulatory bodies.

## Description of Data:

The dataset consists of historical records of aircraft accidents, including aircraft type, engine type, flight phase, and fatality statistics.

Key features include aircraft make, accident count, serious injuries, and fatalities over time.

## Visualizations:

Total Serious Injuries by Aircraft Category: Displays the distribution of serious injuries across different aircraft categories, highlighting the dominance of airplanes.

Proportion of Accidents by Aircraft Make: Shows accident proportions by aircraft manufacturer, with Cessna having the highest count.

Proportion of Fatalities by Phase of Flight: Illustrates fatalities across different phases of flight, with landing and cruise phases being significant contributors.

Aircraft Fatalities by Year: Presents the trend of fatalities over time, showing peaks and gradual declines.

Proportion of Fatal Injuries by Aircraft Engine Type: Highlights fatal injuries by engine type, with reciprocating engines having the highest fatality count.

## Conclusion

## Summary of Findings:

Airplanes account for the highest number of serious injuries, indicating that they contribute significantly to aviation accident statistics.

Cessna aircraft have the highest number of accidents, making them a focal point for safety improvements.

Fatalities are highest during the landing and cruise phases, emphasizing the importance of enhanced safety measures during these flight phases.

These insights help inform stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to improve aviation safety and mitigate risks.
